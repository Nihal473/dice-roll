This is a simple **Dice Rolling Simulator** written in C — my **first ever C project**!  
I made it just for fun while learning the basics of the C programming language. Now it's here, archived with love and nostalgia. 😊

## 📌 What it does

This program simulates rolling a six-sided die. When you run it, it generates and prints a random number between 1 and 6 — just like rolling a real dice.

## 🧠 What I learned

- Writing and compiling a basic C program
- Using `rand()` to generate random numbers
- Working with `time.h` for seeding randomness
- Compiling C code using GCC
- Running `.exe` on Windows from PowerShell (even through antivirus battles 😅)

## 🛠 How to Run

### ▶️ Compile:
Make sure you have GCC installed.

```bash
gcc dice-roll.c -o dice-roll
./dice-roll
```

⚠️ On Windows, you might get a false positive from antivirus. Add an exclusion or run from a safe dev folder.
